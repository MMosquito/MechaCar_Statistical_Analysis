## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Non-random appears when something new, sometimes unexpected, starts to influence the process.  In this case the coefficients that provided non-random amount of variance to the mpg values is the vehicle length and the ground clearance.

### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
In this case the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because there is a significant linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable, therefore the slope will not equal zero. 


### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Determining whether or not this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes is effective is based off the Multiple R-Squared: 0.7149.  This measurement is how close our date is to the linear model on a scale of 0 to 1.  Because the number is closer to 1 it is considered an effective model. 


## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
No the current manufacturing data does meet this design specification.  Based off the suspension coil and lot summary data the median PSI far exceeds the 100 pounds per square inch.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

### Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

#### What metric or metrics are you going to test?

#### What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?

#### What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?

#### What data is needed to run the statistical test?
